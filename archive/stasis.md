<p>CCO provides sophisticated resources for representing time without delving into the more sophisticated temporal representations of previous versions of BFO. Nevertheless, there is a need to represent constancy over time, such as Mary’s temperature being normal over a series of measurements, the average altitude of flight, or how long a suspect was detained. Consider repeated measurements of Mary’s temperature over the course of a day. One strategy for representing the phenomenon in question is to assert that Mary is the bearer of an instance of temperature that carries some text value within a normal range, and so warrants classification as a ‘normal measurement’. Such a strategy does not, however, provide the ability to represent a single measurement datum in a record indicating that, say, “On Friday 3/15/24, Mary’s temperature was normal.”</p>
<p>The strategy adopted by CCO is to introduce the class stasis, a process in which an aspect of one or more independent continuants endures in an unchanging condition. Intuitively, the constancy of Mary’s ‘normal’ temperature is represented by connecting measurements of Mary’s temperature to a proper process part of bodily processes she participates in over some interval, during which qualities that impact Mary’s temperature are measured as within some range of normalcy. In this case, the relevant proper process part count as a stasis. Put another way, we can think of Mary’s ‘normal’ temperature as the subject of some interval measurement information content entity - since such measurements typically have no absolute zero. Mary’s temperature stasis has participant the temperature that is subject of that interval measurement information content entity. Mary’s ‘normal’ temperature is then captured by asserting Mary’s temperature stasis occurs on some temporal interval designated by a date identifier, a CCO class used to denote specific days, which in this case will have value “3/15/24”.</p>

<p>Related, CCO provides resources for the representation of the gain or loss of dependent entities because of some process. The extensive class structure of CCO’s Quality Ontology – initiated by adapting classes from the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6169674/">Phenotypic Trait Ontology (PATO)</a> - provides a storehouse of qualities that may be involved in such processes. The CCO class change represents a process in which some independent continuant endures and (1) one or more of the dependent entities it bears increase or decrease in intensity, (2) the entity begins to bear some dependent entity or (3) the entity ceases to bear some dependent entity. Following the BFO hierarchy of dependent entities, subclasses cover decrease, gain of, increase of, and loss of dependent continuants, each of which contains subclasses for specifically dependent continuants and generically dependent continuants. Regarding the former, if a portion of H2O is frozen, it loses its liquidity disposition, represented as this portion of H2O participating in a loss of disposition. Regarding the latter, receipt on your local network of a PDF file sent via email reflects a gain of generically dependent continuant.</p>
